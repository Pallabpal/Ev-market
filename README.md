## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive market analysis for the electric vehicle (EV) industry in India, focusing on geographic, demographic, and behavioral segments. The goal is to identify opportunities and challenges for establishing and growing an EV startup in the Indian market.
## Methodology
To analyze the data and derive meaningful insights, we employed various techniques and algorithms, including Machine Learning. The following libraries were utilized: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Principal Component Analysis, and K Means Clustering. These methodologies allowed us to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, enabling a deeper understanding of the Indian EV market.

By applying these techniques, our aim was to provide valuable insights into the geographic, demographic, and behavioral segments of the Indian EV market. The findings of this analysis will help identify potential market opportunities, understand customer preferences and needs, evaluate the competitive landscape, and develop a strategic roadmap for the successful establishment and growth of an EV startup in India.
## Conclusion
Through our comprehensive market analysis, we have successfully identified distinct market segments within the Indian EV industry, each with unique preferences and priorities. These segments include cost-conscious consumers seeking affordable options, as well as early adopters who prioritize advanced technology and performance. Understanding these segments will allow businesses to refine their market segmentation strategies and effectively target and cater to the specific needs of each segment.

Moreover, our analysis also highlighted key factors influencing EV adoption, such as government policies and infrastructure development. By addressing these factors, stakeholders in the EV ecosystem can collaborate to create an enabling environment that fosters the growth of the industry.
